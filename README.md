# Introduction

Simple docker image to run web service that will search a local copy of
Troy Hunt's [Pwned Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords),
using `sgrep` in a CGI script.

# How To Use

To use this image, download a copy of Troy Hunt's SHA-1 Pwned Password list,
*ordered by hash*, from <https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords>,
and uncompress it.

From the directory containing the `pwned-passwords-sha1-ordered-by-hash-v?.txt`
file, run:

```
docker run --rm -t \
	-v $PWD:/data \
	-p 2080:80 cliffordw/pwned-httpd
```

# URLs

It exposes 3 URLs, namely:

## hash

`/hash/{password}` returns the SHA1 hash of a password.

Example:

```
$ curl http://0.0.0.0:2080/hash/Password
8BE3C943B1609FFFBFC51AAD666D0A04ADF83C9D
```

## pwnedpassword

`/pwnedpassword/{sha1hash}` checks if the password with this hash has been breached.

The HTTP status code indicates whether a match is found. Possible status codes are:

- 400 Bad Request: returned if we can't find the data file, or you don't specify a hash
- 202 OK: we found the hash. Message body contains the count.
- 404 Not found: No match found in breach database

Example 1 - weak password "Password" has 132408 matches:

```
$ curl -v http://0.0.0.0:2080/pwnedpassword/8BE3C943B1609FFFBFC51AAD666D0A04ADF83C9D
*   Trying 0.0.0.0:2080...

Example 2 - random password "EffAjcadigucGeys" isn't in the list (note 404 status code):

```
$ curl http://0.0.0.0:2080/hash/EffAjcadigucGeys
76A09C6B1E7DF82E2AC8227F92F4FA7054B8DEE2
