# Introduction

Docker image to run web service that will search a local copy of
Troy Hunt's [Pwned Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords).

# How To Use

To use this image, download a copy of version 3 of Troy Hunt's SHA-1 Pwned
Password list, ordered by hash, from <https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords>,
and uncompress it.

From the directory containing the `pwned-passwords-v3-ordered-by-hash.txt`
file, run:

```
docker run --rm -t \
	-v $PWD:/data \
	-p 2080:80 pwned-httpd
```

# URLs

It exposes 3 URLs, namely:

## hash

`/hash/{password}` returns the SHA1 hash of a password.

## pwnedpassword

`/pwnedpassword/{sha1hash}` checks if the password with this hash has been breached.

The HTTP status code indicates whether a match is found. Possible status codes are:

- 400 Bad Request: returned if we can't find the data file, or you don't specify a hash
- 202 OK: we found the hash. Message body contains the count.
- 404 Not found: No match found in breach database

## status

Reports on the status of the container, for Docker healthchecks.
