# Introduction

Simple container image to run web service that will search a local copy
of Troy Hunt's [Pwned Password](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)
SHA1 hashes, using `sgrep` in a CGI script.

For suggestions on integration practices, read the [Pwned Passwords launch blog post](https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-306-million-freely-downloadable-pwned-passwords/). 

# How To Use

## Downloading the Pwned Passwords list

To use this image, you need a downloaded copy of Troy Hunt's Pwned
Password list from <https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords>.
This contains an ordered list of SHA-1 hashes and a count of occurences
for breached passwords.

As of May 2022, the best way to get the most up to date passwords is to use
[the Pwned Passwords downloader](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/PwnedPasswordsDownloader).
You can download this as a single file or as smaller individual `.txt` files.

## Running the container image

If using the individual hash `.txt` files, you need to mount the directory
containing the files to `/data` in the container. Assuming you're in that
directory, you can run:

```sh
podman run --rm -t \
	-v $PWD:/data \
	-p 2080:8080 \
	pwned-httpd
```

If you downloaded the hashes into a single file, you also need to provide
the file name in the `$FILENAME` environment variable, for example:

```sh
podman run --rm -t \
	-v $PWD:/data \
	-p 2080:8080 \
	-e FILENAME=pwnedpasswords.txt \
	pwned-httpd
```

# URLs

It exposes 3 URLs, namely:

## `/hash`

`/hash/{password}` returns the SHA1 hash of a password.

Example:

```
$ curl http://0.0.0.0:2080/hash/abcde
03DE6C570BFE24BFC328CCD7CA46B76EADAF4334
```

This is for convenience / testing only. It would be safer to do this offline :-)
Many options exist for doing this. One example is this Python snippet:

```sh
python -c 'import hashlib; print(hashlib.sha1("Password".encode()).hexdigest());'
```

## `/pwnedpassword`

`/pwnedpassword/{sha1hash}` checks if the password with this hash has been breached.

The HTTP status code indicates whether a match is found. Possible status codes are:

- 400 Bad Request: returned if we can't find the data file, or you don't specify a hash
- 202 OK: we found the hash - the response body contains the match count
- 404 Not found: No match found in breach database

Example 1 - weak password "abcde" has 51725 matches:

```
$ curl -v http://0.0.0.0:2080/pwnedpassword/03DE6C570BFE24BFC328CCD7CA46B76EADAF4334

Example 2 - random password "EffAjcadigucGeys" isn't in the list (note 404 status code):

```
$ curl http://0.0.0.0:2080/hash/EffAjcadigucGeys
76A09C6B1E7DF82E2AC8227F92F4FA7054B8DEE2

## `/status`

Reports on the status of the container, for healthchecks.
